# Wildlander launcher

A launcher for the [Wildlander](https://www.wildlandermod.com/) modpack.

The intention of the launcher is to ease the installation process for modpacks that utilise [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/) but require extra steps.  
This includes copying game files, installing prerequisites, various support options, etc.
The idea is to attempt to make the installation of a modpack more of a one click procedure.
